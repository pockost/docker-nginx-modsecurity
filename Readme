1.15.2, latest ([1.15.2/Dockerfile](https://github.com/pockost/docker-nginx-modsecurity/blob/master/1.15.2/Dockerfile))


ModSecurity
===========

ModSecurity is a Web Application Firewall (WAF). There is two part :

* libModSecurity is the core of the project. This one can analyse web request and apply filter based on rule set.
* modsecurity plugins are the binding allowing webserver (Apache, Nginx, ...) to forward received request to libModSecurity.

For more information you can read <https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/tree/v3/master>.

Image building
==============

The docker image pockost/nginx-modsecurity is build to be smallest as possible. To achieve this the image is build in two stage.

The first stage build all shared object library.
The second one copy only needed library to an official alpine-linux based official nginx image.

Rules and OWASP
===============

ModSecurity need a list of rules to work as expected. If you place all your rules info `/etc/modsecurity/rules` an init script will generate a `/etc/modsecurity/main.conf` file. You can use this file in your nginx configuration to enable modsecurity like that :

```
# /etc/nginx/conf.d/modsecurity.conf
modsecurity on;
modsecurity_rules_file /etc/modsecurity/main.conf;
```

If you don't have any rule set the OWASP provide some. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) project maintain a list of ModSecurity rules. You can find rules here : https://coreruleset.org/

Additionally, if you plan to use the OWASP ruleset, you have to include the crs-setup.conf in your rules folder.


Available environment variable :
================================

* `AUTODISCOVERY_RULES` set to no to disable auto discovery of rules.


Usage example
=============
`docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/rules/:/etc/modsecurity/rules/  pockost/nginx-modsecurity:latest`

You can also find an example on github repositiory.
